# Crypto Price Tracker

This repository contains two main projects:

- /web-app: A Next.js application that displays live cryptocurrency prices using React Query, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js.
- /docs: A Docusaurus documentation site explaining the project setup, API integration, state management, and development challenges.

## Getting Started

### Web App

1. Navigate to the "web-app" folder:
   cd web-app
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server on port 3001:
   npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser.

### Documentation

1. Navigate to the "docs" folder:
   cd docs
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the documentation site on port 3002:
   npm run start
4. Open the URL provided in your terminal (typically http://localhost:3002).

## Next Steps

1. Clone the repository and create the folder structure as shown.
2. Copy each file's content into the respective files.
3. Install dependencies in both the /web-app and /docs directories.
4. Run the development servers for both the web app and the documentation on their respective ports.

This complete setup meets the assignment requirements and demonstrates:
- API integration (using the CoinGecko API)
- State management with React Query
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS (including dark mode)
- Historical price chart integration (via Chart.js)
- Thorough documentation via Docusaurus

Feel free to ask if you need further customization or help with deployment configurations!
